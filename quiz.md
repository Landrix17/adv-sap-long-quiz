## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
- It is a compilation of codes that provide a service to make a business function in process, it is shared and reusable and will provide services that can be used within multiple separate systems for different business domains where it enables the development of applications easier and securely.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- SOA has a standardized service contract where you can set goals and purpose for the service you will develop, SOA has a loose coupling which will lessen the dependencies between different systems with a constant emphasis, SOA contains Abstraction where it provides security by encapsulating implementation details that will show a consistent simplified interface for service data access, SOA is has a service reusability by maximizing reuse, SOA has an autonomy that it can be independent upon its improvements to providing service, SOA has statelessness trait where it can reduce resource consumption to handle more service request, SOA has discoverability where it is easily access for users service, SOA has composability where it's designed can be reused for multiple solutions where it can be composition of services, lastly SOA, has interoperability where it can execute on various software platforms and hardware architectures.

3. Define Microservices.
- It divides large applications into smaller parts where those small parts of services will have their own process or function, it is an individual application that is a cloud-native approach that communicates well over well-defined APIs.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- It is independently deployable for it can be widely used for every team or individual because of its small division of services resulting in creating patterns for easier understanding. It is the right tool for the job because of its optimization of services because it can deployed easily resulting in a futureproof technology evolution.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- The main difference is that SOA is for larger handling that focuses on the reuse of integrations while microservices is for small handling that focuses on the division of services breaking down large services into small blocks of services for detailed processes. The similarity is that it allows every development team to build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently for cloud environments.

6. Define Web Services.
- It is a service accessed only via the internet and provides communication between two electronic devices over a network. It is programmed as a messaging system to exchange data over computer networks like an inter-process communication in a single computer. 

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
- It exposes the existing function on the network, with this other applications can use the program you are using on the network where they can reuse it for their own use. It is interoperable because other applications can communicate and share data among themselves where it makes any application platform independent. It has a standardized protocol, because its protocols provides you wide range of choices and reduction in competitions. It is a low cost communication because of Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP) where it exchanges info over a particular protocol.
 
8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
- it is XML-based for it can eliminate OS and platform binding, It is loosely coupled where the interface of web service can change over time, it is coarse grained where it can identify the capabilities of the method for business logic, It has the ability for synchronous and asynchronous execution of the service, It supports Remote Procedure Calls(RPCs) where it invokes procedures, functions and methods using XML-based protocol
and lastly is supports Document Exchange for business integration

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
- The provider is the creator of web services and makes it shareable, the requestor is the client application  that needs to contact a web service, and the broker is the one that provides the UDDI where it enables the application to locate the web service

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
- SOAP is an xml-based protocol for exchanging info between computers, WSDL is where it defines the web service and give info how to access it, and lastly UDDI is for describing, publishing, and finding web services.
